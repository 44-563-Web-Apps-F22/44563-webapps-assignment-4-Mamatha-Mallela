  <h4>ACT II — Scene : Night QUARTER-DECK OF H.M.S. PINAFORE, OFF PORTSMOUTH</h4>
  <p class="song"> SONG—CAPTAIN
  <p>
    Fair moon, to thee I sing,
    Bright regent of the heavens,
    Say, why is everything
    Either at sixes or at sevens?
    I have lived hitherto
    Free from breath of slander,
    Beloved by all my crew—
    A really popular commander.
    But now my kindly crew rebel,
    My daughter to a tar is partial,
    Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell,
    He threatens a court martial!
    Fair moon, to thee I sing,
    Bright regent of the heavens,
    Say, why is everything
    Either at sixes or at sevens?</p>
  </p>
  <p>
  <h6 class="name">BUT</h6> 
  <p class="BUT"> How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the unconscious moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may be! Who is
  poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall on one so lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!</p>

  <h6 class="name">CAPT</h6>
  <p class="direction">(coming down)</p>
  <p class="CAPT">Ah! Little Buttercup, still on board? That is not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable to have
  gone on shore at dusk.</p>

  <h6 class="name">BUT</h6> 
  <p class="BUT">True, dear Captain—but the recollection of your sad pale face seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile
  before I go.</p>

  <h6 class="name">CAPT</h6> 
  <p class="CAPT">Ah! Little Buttercup, I fear it will be long before I recover my accustomed cheerfulness, for misfortunes crowd upon
  me, and all my old friends seem to have turned against me!</p>

  <h6 class="name">BUT</h6> 
  <p class="BUT">Oh no—do not say "all", dear Captain. That were unjust to one, at least.</p>

  <h6 class="name">CAPT</h6> 
  <p class="CAPT">True, for you are staunch to me.</p> <p class="direction">(Aside.)</p> 
  <p class="CAPT">If ever I gave my heart again, methinks it would be to such a one as this!</p>
  <p class="direction">(Aside.)</p>
  <p class="CAPT">I am touched to the heart by your innocent regard for me, and were we
  differently situated, I think I could have returned it. But as it is, I fear I can never be more to you than a friend.</p>
  
  <h6 class="name">BUT</h6> 
  <p class="BUT">I understand! You hold aloof from me because you are rich and
  lofty—and I poor and lowly. But take care! The poor bumboat woman has
  gipsy blood in her veins, and she can read destinies.</p>

  <h6 class="name">CAPT.</h6> 
  <p class="CAPT">Destinies?</p>

  <h6 class="name">BUT</h6> 
  <p class="BUT">There is a change in store for you!</p>

  <h6 class="name">CAPT.</h6> 
  <p class="CAPT">A change?</p>

  <h6 class="name">BUT</h6> 
  <p class="BUT">Aye—be prepared!</p>

  <h6 class="name">BUT</h6>
  <p class="BUT">Things are seldom what they seem, Skim milk masquerades as cream;
  Highlows pass as patent leathers; Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.</p>

  <h6 class="name">CAPT</h6>
  <p class="CAPT">Very true, So they do.</p>

  <h6 class="name">BUT</h6>
  <p class="BUT">Black sheep dwell in every fold; All that glitters is not gold; Storks turn out to be but logs;
  Bulls are but inflated frogs.</p>

  <h6 class="name">CAPT</h6>
  <p class="direction">(puzzled)</p> 
  <p class="CAPT">So they be, Frequentlee.</p>

  <h6 class="name">BUT</h6>
  <p class="BUT">
  Drops the wind and stops the mill; Turbot is ambitious brill; Gild the farthing if you will,
  Yet it is a farthing still.</p>

  <h6 class="name">CAPT.</h6>
  <p class="direction">(puzzled).</p> 
  <p class="CAPT">Yes, I know. That is so. Though to catch your drift I'm striving,
  It is shady—it is shady; I don't see at what you're driving, Mystic lady—mystic lady.</p>
  <p class="direction">(Aside.)</p>
  <p class="CAPT">Stern conviction's o'er me stealing, That the mystic lady's dealing In oracular revealing.</p>
  
  <h6 class="name">BUT</h6>
  <p class="direction">(aside).</p>
  <p class="BUT">
  Stern conviction's o'er him stealing, That the mystic lady's dealing In oracular revealing.
  Yes, I know— That is so!</p></p>

  <p class="speech">The hours creep on apace,
    My guilty heart is quaking!
    Oh, that I might retrace
    The step that I am taking!
    Its folly it were easy to be showing,
    What I am giving up and whither going.
    On the one hand, papa's luxurious home,
    Hung with ancestral armour and old brasses,
    Carved oak and tapestry from distant Rome,
    Rare "blue and white" Venetian finger-glasses,
    Rich oriental rugs, luxurious sofa pillows,
    And everything that isn't old, from Gillow's.
    And on the other, a dark and dingy room,
    In some back street with stuffy children crying,
    Where organs yell, and clacking housewives fume,
    And clothes are hanging out all day a-drying.
    With one cracked looking-glass to see your face
    in,
    And dinner served up in a pudding basin!</p>
