        <h4>ACT II — Scene : Night QUARTER-DECK OF H.M.S. PINAFORE, OFF PORTSMOUTH</h4>
        <p> Fair moon, to thee I sing,
            Bright regent of the heavens,
          Say, why is everything
            Either at sixes or at sevens?
          I have lived hitherto
            Free from breath of slander,
          Beloved by all my crew—
            A really popular commander.
          But now my kindly crew rebel,
            My daughter to a tar is partial,
          Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell,
            He threatens a court martial!
             Fair moon, to thee I sing,
               Bright regent of the heavens,
             Say, why is everything
               Either at sixes or at sevens?
</p>
<p>Though a mystic tone { I } borrow,
    you
You will } learn the truth with sorrow,
I shall
Here to-day and gone to-morrow;
Yes, I know—
That is so!
[At the end exit LITTLE BUTTERCUP
melodramatically.

CAPT. Incomprehensible as her utterances are, I nevertheless
feel that
they are dictated by a sincere regard for me. But to what new
misery is
she referring? Time alone can tell!</p>
<p>The hours creep on apace,
    My guilty heart is quaking!
  Oh, that I might retrace
    The step that I am taking!
Its folly it were easy to be showing,
What I am giving up and whither going.
On the one hand, papa's luxurious home,
Hung with ancestral armour and old brasses,
Carved oak and tapestry from distant Rome,
Rare "blue and white" Venetian finger-glasses,
Rich oriental rugs, luxurious sofa pillows,
And everything that isn't old, from Gillow's.
And on the other, a dark and dingy room,
In some back street with stuffy children crying,
Where organs yell, and clacking housewives fume,
And clothes are hanging out all day a-drying.
With one cracked looking-glass to see your face
in,
And dinner served up in a pudding basin!

  A simple sailor, lowly born,
       Unlettered and unknown,
  Who toils for bread from early mom
       Till half the night has flown!
  No golden rank can he impart—
       No wealth of house or land—
  No fortune save his trusty heart
       And honest brown right hand!
       And yet he is so wondrous fair
       That love for one so passing rare,
       So peerless in his manly beauty,
       Were little else than solemn duty!
Oh, god of love, and god of reason, say,
Which of you twain shall my poor heart obey!</p>
